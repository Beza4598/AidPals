## Project Specification
## Problem statement

Many individuals, groups, and families often struggle to cover emergency costs (e.g., healthcare, funeral) and fear for their financial outlook. Users desire a personalized crowdfunding platform to contribute to and secure emergency funds (e.g., from friends and family, local communities, or even affinity groups (e.g., LGBTQ+, BIPOC)).


## Summary

Today, crowdfunding is not a reliable tool for covering emergencies, with over 90% of GoFundMe medical campaigns failing to reach their financial target. Additionally, current crowdfunding sources are impersonal and commercialized, with emphasis on storytelling. Campaigns that share an excess of personal information have shown to be the most successful, and there are concerns about the vulnerability of patients who feel pressured to subordinate their rights to privacy in order to raise money. Biases can also be roadblocks to funding—crowdfunding has been most effective in areas of high income and education, with donors coming from the same socio-economic class as those in need. This puts those in low-income and underserved communities at a significant disadvantage, and those that donate to strangers are often wary that their money is even going to the correct people/community.

For anyone that struggles with covering emergency costs, especially those in underserved communities, AidPals is a crowdfunding meets mutual aid app that aims to remove bias and the sharing of sensitive information from crowdfunding through a community-centric model. Unlike Indiegogo, MoneyFellows, and GoFundMe, our product comes at no additional usage cost and builds communities between people who need help and those willing to offer it while protecting users' privacy. It also gives those who may need it a safety net for the future through an emergency-focused saving system inspired by rotating savings and mutual aid funds. Through AidPals, our users can comfortably ask for help from people they know or groups they can relate to.
